They mentioned to return only the translation without any explanations or extra words. The original text is \"** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **\". \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I keep the structure and symbols exactly as they are. The asterisks are part of the text, so they should stay. The phrase \"终极时刻15秒后到来\" needs to be translated. \n\n\"终极时刻\" translates to \"终极时刻\" in Chinese, which is already correct. \"15秒后\" is \"15秒后\", and \"到来\" would be \"到来\". Putting it all together, it should be \"** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **\". \n\nWait, the original has the asterisks at the beginning and end. The user said to preserve all special symbols, so I need to keep those. Also, numbers must stay as they are. Let me double-check if there's any part I might have missed. No, the translation seems accurate. I'll make sure there's no extra spacing or characters added. The final translation should be exactly the same structure as the original.\n</think>\n\n** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **",
