      "CN": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a professional game text translator. Let me make sure I understand all the requirements. They need the text translated into Simplified Chinese, and only the translation should be returned. No explanations, quotes, or extra words. I have to keep the numbers exactly the same, not translate them into words. Also, special symbols like ** and << need to stay as they are. The sentence structure and tone should remain unchanged, no embellishments. Avoid complex reasoning, just focus on a clear and concise translation.\n\nThe original text is: ** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **\n\nFirst, I'll translate \"终极时刻\" which is \"Ultimate Moment\" or \"Final Moment\". In game contexts, \"终极时刻\" is commonly used, so that's good. Then \"15秒后到来\" translates to \"15 seconds later arrives\" or \"arrives 15 seconds later\". The structure here is important. The original uses \"到来\" which is \"arrive\" or \"come\". So putting it together, it should be \"** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **\". \n\nWait, the user specified to keep the numbers exactly the same, so \"15秒\" is correct. Also, the symbols ** around the text need to stay. Let me check if there are any other symbols. The original has ** on both sides. So the translation should have the same symbols. \n\nIs there any chance that \"到来\" might be better translated as \"arrives\" in a more natural way? For example, \"终极时刻将在15秒后到来\" would be more natural, but the user wants to keep the structure. The original doesn't use \"将\" (will), so maybe it's better to keep it as is. \n\nAnother consideration: the original uses \"到来\" which is a bit formal. In game texts, sometimes they use more direct terms. But since the user wants to stay faithful to the original, I should use \"到来\" as is. \n\nSo the final translation would be: ** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **. Let me double-check if there are any typos or if the symbols are correctly placed. Yes, the ** are at the beginning and end, and the numbers are preserved. No changes to the structure. That should meet all the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n** 终极时刻15秒后到来 **",
